Please follow this link to download the data I used to make this project:

link = "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qXKSt6jAgh20f-2PkRT-Z61PW-3E4S_z/"

Instruction to run my code:

1-After downloading the data rename it by 'Cat_Dog_DataSet' and put it in the same file with all the codes (main.py, model.py, dataset.py, ...)

2-Rename in the data downloaded the file 'val'  by 'train' and the file 'train' by 'test'
